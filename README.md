StarCraft II Player Skill Classification

This repository contains the scripts pertaining to my project on predicting StarCraft 2 player skill (rank) based on attributes found in the SkillCraft 1 dataset (taken from the UCI Machine Learning Repository (http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/skillcraft1+master+table+dataset))

The different model training scripts all start with the prefix run- (eg. runBNN.py), each pertaining to a different model variant/experiment

Pre-requisites: Keras, Microsoft CNTK, Python.

As this project was initially done in 2018, this is primarily for archival purposes. The scripts may not run with he latest version of the above libraries/tools.
